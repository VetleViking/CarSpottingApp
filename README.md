# Car Spotting App
A website where you can upload images of your spots of cars. Currently under development.


The site is built with NextJS using TypeScript and Tailwind in the frontend, Redis for the database, and Express for the backend. Also utilizing ChatGPT 4.0 lite using the [OpenAI api](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for recognization of cars, as well as [Statens Vegvesen reg api](https://www.vegvesen.no/om-oss/om-organisasjonen/apne-data/et-utvalg-apne-data/api-for-tekniske-kjoretoyopplysninger/) to search up car details for norwegian reg-numbers.
