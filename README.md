# Car Spotting App
A website where you can upload images of your spots of cars. Currently under development.


The site is built with NextJS using TypeScript and Tailwind in the frontend, Redis for the database, and Express for the backend. The site is utilizing ChatGPT 4.0 lite using the [OpenAI api](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for AI-recognization of cars, as well as [Statens Vegvesen reg api](https://www.vegvesen.no/om-oss/om-organisasjonen/apne-data/et-utvalg-apne-data/api-for-tekniske-kjoretoyopplysninger/) to have the ability to search up car details for norwegian reg-numbers.
